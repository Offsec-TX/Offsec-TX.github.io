**Offsec-TX** is an interactive toolkit designed for penetration testers and security professionals to systematically organize, track, and document their test cases across every stage of an engagement. Whether you’re testing networks, web applications, APIs, mobile apps, or Active Directory environments, Offsec-TX helps you stay methodical and efficient.

- **Track Your Assessment:**  
  Leverage methodology-driven checklists to monitor your progress and mark off completed tests across different testing approaches:
  - **Black Box:** No internal knowledge—external perspective.
  - **Grey Box:** Partial knowledge—mixed perspective.
  - **White Box:** Full knowledge—internal perspective.

- **Export and Report:**  
  Effortlessly export your progress and findings for streamlined reporting and documentation.
