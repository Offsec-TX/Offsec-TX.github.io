  1. Enumerate Remote Access Services
     - Identify externally exposed VPN, RDP, Citrix, and related remote access endpoints using port scanning (e.g., with Nmap) and banner grabbing.
     - For RDP: Scan for port 3389 or use Nmap scripts (e.g., rdp-*) and tools such as rdp-scan.
     - For Citrix: Identify typical ports (e.g., 1494, 2598 for ICA or corresponding web interfaces) and enumerate published applications using specialized tools.
     - For VPN: Identify common VPN ports (e.g., 443 for SSL VPN, 500/4500 for IPSec) and use banner grabbing to confirm service types.

  2. Validate Credentials Against Remote Services
     - Attempt authentication on VPN, RDP, and Citrix endpoints using the discovered user credentials.
     - For RDP: Use tools like Hydra or Ncrack to perform credential-based login attempts. For example:
       
           hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt rdp://<target-ip>
       
       This simulates login attempts and identifies weak or reused credentials.
     - For Citrix: Attempt to authenticate to web front-ends or ICA clients with the discovered credentials. Utilize enumeration tools to list published apps and validate access.
     - For VPN: Use the VPN client or command-line tools to test credential validity. For SSL VPNs, test authentication via the web portal and, if successful, attempt to establish full tunnel access.

  3. Assess Exposure and Security Posture
     - Document which credentials are successful and note if any provide access to privileged resources or administrative interfaces.
     - Evaluate whether multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforcedâ€”a lack of MFA significantly increases risk if credentials are compromised.
     - Check if remote access leads directly to sensitive internal network segments, enabling potential lateral movement or privilege escalation.
     - Monitor for signs of excessive privileges, poor network segmentation between remote services and the internal network, and insufficient session or logging controls.

  4. Report and Recommend
     - Provide detailed findings including which services are exposed, the credentials that worked, the level of internal access achieved, and any instances of excessive privileges or inadequate segmentation.
     - Recommend remediations such as enforcing strong authentication (e.g., MFA), minimizing external exposure of sensitive services, performing regular credential audits, and enhancing network segmentation.
