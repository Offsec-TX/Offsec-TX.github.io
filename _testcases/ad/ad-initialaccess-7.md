how-to-test: |
  1. Enumeration of Internet-Exposed Applications
     a. Asset Discovery:
        - Use reconnaissance tools like Shodan, Nmap, or Censys to detect open ports, subdomains, and public IP addresses.
     b. Fingerprinting:
        - Determine application types, technologies, server software, frameworks, and plugins using banner grabbing, web crawlers, or tools such as WhatWeb or Wappalyzer.
     c. Public Exposure Verification:
        - Cross-check discovered assets with corporate registries to confirm no unauthorized or shadow applications are exposed.

  2. Vulnerability Assessment and Weakness Identification
     a. Vulnerability Scanning:
        - Run automated dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools and tailored vulnerability scanners to detect issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), authentication weaknesses, or misconfigurations.
        - Use both authenticated and unauthenticated scans to cover public and restricted areas.
     b. OWASP Top 10 Risks:
        - Focus on vulnerabilities such as broken authentication, security misconfigurations, and vulnerable components.
     c. Configuration Analysis:
        - Check for poor segmentation between external applications and the internal network, excessive trust relationships, and default credentials.

  3. Testing for Lateral Movement Pathways
     a. Pivot Testing:
        - Use compromised application hosts to pivot into the internal network.
        - Scan for open internal ports and reachable network segments.
        - Simulate actions such as installing web shells, reverse shells, or tunneling tools.
     b. Access and Privilege Escalation:
        - Attempt to escalate privileges through local exploits or by harvesting credentials from the application server.
     c. Internal Reconnaissance:
        - Once a pivot is successful, enumerate internal hosts, trust relationships, and sensitive services.
        - Use tools to scan for legacy protocols, shared folders, internal admin interfaces, and lateral movement vectors such as RDP, SMB, or SSH.

  4. Recommendations and Reporting
     a. Comprehensive Documentation:
        - Record all findings including exposed services, vulnerabilities with evidence, and paths from internet-facing apps to internal assets.
     b. Remediation Advice:
        - Recommend network segmentation, regular patching, hardening of authentication, removal of unnecessary services, continuous monitoring, and proactive external penetration testing.
